# TwilioWrapper
A full php website that allows you to recieve text messages from twilio in desktop applications with the complication of having to setup a server inside the applicaiton. Just create and account and give twilio the url. Now all your program has to do is request the PHP server and ask for new text messages. The json response can easily be decoded to display in your app. 

# Installation
